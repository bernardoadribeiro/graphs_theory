# Graphs Theory

This repository contains the exercises resolution of the Graphs Theory discipline, offered in the course Bachelor in Information Systems offered by IFNMG JanuÃ¡ria.


### What is as Graph?
> According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)), a graphs is _"a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge."_. 

> In resume, Graph can be everything that has some relationship with another thing. E.g.: Database Entities, Route among cities, Network, etc.

### Folder structure
- [deep_search_algorithm/](./deep_search_algorithm/): Contains a Algorithm for Deep-First Search.
- [graph_convert_dict2matrix/](./graph_convert_dict2matrix/): Contains the algorithm to convert the graph representation between `dict` and `matrix`.
- [graphs_hypercubes/](./graphs_hypercubes/): Contains the algorithm to generate a N-dimensional Hypercube.
- [graphs_musical_scale/](./graphs_musical_scale/): Contains the algorithm to generate musical scales using a cromatic note. ***Obs.:** Needs improvement.*
- [graphs_tictactoe/](./graphs_tictactoe/): Contains the algorithm for apllying the concepts of Generator Tree and Hypercube to generate all the possibilities for tic-tac-toe game, using the player game as base to generate the Graph.


### How to Run
- First, you need to clone this repository in your machine.
- After cloning this repository, you need to change your directory to the folder where the algorithm was implemented.
- Then, see the Readme in it's directory for more instructions.
Obs: Some algorithms may need external libs, so to run them, is necessary that you install the dependencies before run.
